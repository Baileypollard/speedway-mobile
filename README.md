# Looney Speedway Mobile

This application was designed to solve a "real life" problem that I encountered at the Riverside Speedway in Antigonish Nova Scotia. As I was sitting in the "nose bleed" seats, I couldn't help but notice the lack of view of the position board. I then thought to myself ... how can I fix solve this using technology?

This personal project was the result of that question, as I believed it needed a solution. This is strictly a personal project, and has not yet been pitched to any representatives of the Riverside Speedway yet hence why it is not branded with the name.

This mobile application uses React Native for the cross-platform support, along with Google's Cloud Firestore for the NoSQL and instant data syncing to user devices. This mobile application offers a live view of the active races contestant positions, while making use of React Natives animation library to enhance the users personal experience. The application offers a read only version of the contestant positions, while the Admin web-panel provides the means to perform CRUD operations on contestants, races, and live races through the React.js web framework.

This project is ongoing as of March 2nd 2020, and will continue being my personal project until I deem it completed.
